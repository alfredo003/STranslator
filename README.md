STranslated
==================

STranslated is an intelligent text translator that can translate text or words into any desired language. It utilizes a combination of Node.js, ChatGPT, and React.js.

How it works
------------------

STranslated leverages the ChatGPT API to identify the language of the text input provided by the user and retrieve the translation in the chosen language.

Here's a breakdown of the translation process:

1. The user enters a text or word they want to translate.
2. STranslated uses the ChatGPT API to analyze the input and determine its language.
3. Based on the identified language, STranslated fetches the corresponding translation in the user's desired language.
4. The translated text is generated and presented in a textual format to the user.

For example, if the user enters the word "hello" and requests the translation into Spanish, STranslated will recognize that the input is in English and provide the translation "hola."

To utilize STranslated, you need to have Node.js and React.js installed. The application's front-end is built using React.js, while Node.js handles the backend logic and integration with the ChatGPT API.
